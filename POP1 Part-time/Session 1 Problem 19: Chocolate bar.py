Chocolate bar has the form of a rectangle divided into nÃ—m portions. Chocolate bar can be split into two rectangular parts by breaking it along a selected straight line on its pattern. 

Determine whether it is possible to split it so that one of the parts will have exactly k squares.
The program reads three integers: n, m, and k. It should print YES or NO.

For example, on input
2
10
7
output must be 
NO
"""
n = int(input())

k = int(input())

area = n * m

if (k % n == 0 or k % m == 0) and area >= k:
  print("YES")
else:
  print("NO")
